Network registration hierarchy
==============================

Service		org.ofono
Interface	org.ofono.NetworkRegistration
Object path	[variable prefix]/{modem0,modem1,...}

Methods		dict GetProperties()

			Returns all network registration properties. See the
			properties section for available properties.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments

		void SetProperty(string name, variant value)

			Changes the value of the specified property. Only
			properties that are listed as read-write are
			changeable. On success a PropertyChanged signal
			will be emitted.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.DoesNotExist

		void Register()

			Attempts to register to the default network. The
			default network is normally selected by the settings
			from the SIM card.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments

		void Deregister()

			Completely unregisters from the network

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments

		array{object} ProposeScan()

			Runs a network operator scan to discover the currently
			available operators.  This operation can take several
			seconds, and up to several minutes on some modems.
			This can be used to help the user determine what is
			the best operator to use if forced to roam on a
			foreign network.

			NOTE: The operator scan can interfere with any active
			GPRS contexts.  Expect the context to be unavailable
			for the duration of the operator scan.

Signals		PropertyChanged(string property, variant value)

			This signal indicates a changed value of the given
			property.

Properties	string Mode [readonly]

			The current registration mode. The deault of this
			is "auto", but can be changed during operation. This
			property will change to "manual" if the Register()
			method of an operator is called.

			The possible values are:
				"auto"     Network registration is performed
				           automatically.
				"manual"   Network operator is selected
				           manually. If the operator is
				           currently not selected, registration
				           is notattempted
				"off"      Unregisters from currently selected
				           network, if any, and does not
				           attempt to register again.

		string Status [readonly]

			The current registration status of a modem.

			The possible values are: 
				"unregistered"  Not registered to any network
				"registered"    Registered to home network
				"searching"     Not registered, but searching
				"denied"        Registration has been denied
				"unknown"       Status is unknown
				"roaming"       Registered, but roaming

		uint16 LocationAreaCode [readonly, optional]

			Contains the current location area code.

			TODO: Agent based location signalling would be better.

		uint32 CellId [readonly, optional]

			Contains the current network cell id.

			TODO: Agent based location signalling would be better.

		string MobileCountryCode [readonly, optional]

			Contains the Mobile Country Code (MCC).  This is
			repeated here for convenience.  It can also be obtained
			from the NetworkOperator interface.

		string MobileNetworkCode [readonly, optional]

			Contains the Mobile Network Code (MNC).  This is
			repeated here for convenience.  It can also be obtained
			from the NetworkOperator interface.

		string Technology [readonly, optional]

			Contains the technology of the current network.

			The possible values are: "gsm", "edge", "umts", "hspa",
							"lte"

			TODO: Values for CDMA and EVDO based networks.

		string Name [readonly]

			Contains the current operator name, suitable for
			display on the idle screen or an empty string if
			not registered to a network.

			This value is idential to the Name property from
			the network operator object. It is provided here
			for simplicity of application that don't allow
			manual registration.

		byte Strength [readonly, optional]

			Contains the current signal strength as a percentage
			between 0-100 percent.

		string BaseStation [readonly, optional]

			If the Cell Broadcast service is available and
			properly configured, this attribute will contain the
			name of the current service cell.  This is typically a
			descriptive name of the local area, e.g. name of the
			suburb.  If no name is provided or becomes
			unavailable, this property will not be returned by
			GetProperties or will be set to an empty string.

		array{object} Operators [readonly]

			List of all operator object paths known to the
			telephony stack. The scanning for new operators is
			done in the background.

			The list of operators is only useful when attempting
			manual registration. The automatic registration is
			the preferred method.


Network operator hierarchy
==========================

Service		org.ofono
Interface	org.ofono.NetworkOperator
Object path	[variable prefix]/{modem0,modem1,...}/{operator0,operator1,...}

Methods		dict GetProperties()

			Returns all network operator properties. See the
			properties section for available properties.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments

		void Register()

			Attempts to register to this network operator.

			The method will return immediately, the result should
			be observed by tracking the NetworkRegistration Status
			property.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments

Signals		PropertyChanged(string property, variant value)

			This signal indicates a changed value of the given
			property.

Properties	string Name [readonly]

			Contains the name of the operator

		string Status [readonly]

			Contains the status of the operator.

			The possible values are: "unknown", "available",
						 "current" and "forbidden"

		string MobileCountryCode [readonly, optional]

			Contains the Mobile Country Code (MCC).

		string MobileNetworkCode [readonly, optional]

			Contains the Mobile Network Code (MNC)

		array{string} Technologies [readonly, optional]

			Contains a list of technologies currently available
			from this network provider.

			The possible values are: "gsm", "edge", "umts", "hspa",
							"lte"

		string AdditionalInformation [readonly, optional]

			Contains a short description of the operator.  This is
			typically stored on the SIM and might be available
			only for select operators.
