Data Connection Manager hierarchy
=================

Service		org.ofono
Interface	org.ofono.DataConnectionManager
Object path	[variable]

Methods		dict GetProperties()

			Returns all global system properties. See the
			properties section for available properties.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments

		void SetProperty(string property, variant value)

			Sets the property to a desired value

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.InvalidFormat
					 [service].Error.Failed

		void DeactivateAll()

			Deactivates all active contexts.

		object CreateContext(string name, string type)

			Creates a new Primary context.  The name is a free
			form string that describes this context.  The name
			should not be empty and limited to a short string
			for display purposes.  The type contains the intended
			purpose of the context.  For possible values see the
			Type documentation of PrimaryDataContext interface.
			Returns the object path of the created context.

		void RemoveContext(object context)

			Removes a primary context.  All secondary contexts, if
			any, associated with the primary context are also
			removed.

Signals		PropertyChanged(string property, variant value)

			This signal indicates a changed value of the given
			property.

Properties	array{object} PrimaryContexts [readonly]

			List of all primary context objects.

		boolean Attached [readonly]

			Contains whether the Packet Radio Service is attached.
			The attach state might change dynamically based on
			availability of network resources.  If this value
			changes to false, the user can assume that all
			contexts have been deactivated.

			If the modem is detached, certain features will not
			be available, e.g. receiving SMS over packet radio
			or network initiated PDP activation.

		boolean RoamingAllowed [readwrite]

			Contains whether data roaming is allowed.  In the off
			setting, if the packet radio registration state
			indicates that the modem is roaming, oFono will
			automatically detach and no further connection
			establishment will be possible.

		boolean Powered [readwrite]

			Controls whether packet radio use is allowed. Setting
			this value to off detaches the modem from the
			Packet Domain network.
