Background
==========

- Priority scale: High, Medium and Low

- Complexity scale: C1, C2, C4 and C8.  The complexity scale is exponential,
  with complexity 1 being the lowest complexity.  Complexity is a function
  of both task 'complexity' and task 'scope'.

  The general rule of thumb is that a complexity 1 task should take 1-2 weeks
  for a person very familiar with oFono codebase.  Higher complexity tasks
  require more time and have higher uncertainty.

  Higher complexity tasks should be refined into several lower complexity tasks
  once the task is better understood.


SMS
===

- Add support for Enhanced SMS (EMS) from 3GPP 23.040.  These SMS messages
  support a richer set of formatting elements, including bold/italic and
  font size selection.  Embedding images and sounds into the SMS is also
  supported.  This task should add support for receiving such SMS messages.

  Proposed solution is to convert such messages to HTML and embed image /
  sound data as embedded MIME in the generated HTML stream.  The EMS messages
  will have to be detected (by the presence of particular tags in the SMS)
  and signaled seperately from simple SMS messages.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C8

- Source / Destination port addressing scheme from 3GPP 23.040.  A special
  header is used to indicate the source / destination port of the application
  this SMS message belongs to.  Such messages which are encoded in 8-bit should
  be decoded by oFono automatically.  The handler associated with this source /
  destination port is called with the decoded stream.

  Proposed solution involves a registration / callback framework in the SMS
  atom for plugins to register handlers.  Default (wildcard) handler is also
  desired.

- Smart Messaging Service.  This is a separate standard from Nokia and uses
  the 3GPP 23.040 source / destination addressing scheme.  The main aim of
  this task is to support vCards and vCalendar objects over SMS.

  Proposed solution is to add a plugin with an extension API to send / receive
  such messages.

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C2
  Depends: Source / Destination port scheme

- WAP PUSH notification support for MMS.  oFono should be able to receive
  WAP PUSH messages over SMS, parse them and report them to the upper level
  MMS stack.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C8

- See / Cancel pending SMS messages over DBus.  When oFono sends SMS messages
  the method call is only returned when the message has been submitted to the
  network.  Instead we should return an object path and allow cancellation of
  pending messages.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2

- Persist outgoing SMS messages.  Currently oFono persists incoming messages
  that are fragmented.  However oFono does not persist queued outgoing
  messages.  oFono should persist such messages and restore / requeue them
  on the next oFono startup.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C1

- Better unique ID for incoming / outgoing messages.  Currently oFono uses
  a simple incremental counter stored in the settings store (NextMessageId).
  This tends to break quite easily in strange situations (e.g. forced battery
  removal, unexpected crashes).  This makes the uniqueness of this ID not
  always guaranteed.

  Proposed solution is to base the ID on SHA1 or MD5 hash.  Hash the contents
  of the message + reception / sent time and the sender / originator address.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C1

- SMS Status Report support support according to 3GPP 23.040.  oFono should
  support SMS start reports.  For fragmented SMS messages oFono should take
  care of collating the status reports for each fragment and notifying once
  all fragments are received.

  SMS call history should be updated with support of SMS 'delivered' or
  'undeliverable' status.

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C4

SIM / SIM File system
=====================

- Fixed Dialing support.  oFono should support Fixed Dialing Numbers.  This
  requires being able to edit the FD phonebook or assume that the FD phonebook
  has been appropriately bootstrapped.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C2

- Barred Numbers.  oFono should support Barred Numbers capability.  This
  requires ability to read & write EFadn entries on the SIM.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C4

- Read / Write EFcfis.  Call forwarding settings can be bootstrapped on the
  SIM for faster notification of the user that call forwarding is active.
  These settings are stored in EFcfis.  oFono should read these settings and
  update the call history atom appropriately.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C2

- SIM Call History plugin.  New UICCs support four new SIM elementary files
  for storing call history information on the SIM: EFici, EFict, EFoci, EFoct.
  A plugin should be developed for oFono that will write to these files.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C2

- Support proprietory extensions for SIM PIN retry counter.  Most vendors
  provide an extension commands to obtain such a retry counter for PINs and
  PUKs.  Need to enable this as a property in oFono.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C2


Modem Emulator
==============

- Support HFP AG emulator.  We should provide a new HFP_AG_EMULATOR atom type
  that will implement the Bluetooth HFP AG profile.  Voicecall atom, netreg
  atoms can register command handlers for this atom appropriately.

  Complexity: C4
  Priority: Medium

- Support extensions to HFP AG emulator.  Some carkits support additional
  AT command extensions to the Bluetooth HFP AG standard.  Refer to CE4A
  white paper: "AT-commands for Automotive Premium Phone Integration".
  Plugins can register additional command handlers appropriately to handle
  such commands.

  Complexity: C4
  Priority: Medium
  Depends: HFP AG emulator

- Support HSP AG.  Similar to HFP AG emulator but implements the much reduced
  Bluetooth HSP AG profile.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C1

- Support DUN emulator. Implement the Bluetooth DUN profile with only mandatory
  AT command support.

  Complexity: C4
  Priority: Medium

  Depends: PPP Server mode

- Support Bluetooth SPP profile.

  Complexity: C4
  Priority: Medium


Flight Mode
===========

- Flight Mode support.  Add an 'Online' property to the Modem interface that
  will control the online state of the modem.  When Online state is True all
  atoms are available.  When Online state is False, all network related items
  are removed (e.g. CallSettings) or enter into reduced functionality set
  where only the SIM is available (e.g. DataConnectionManager, SimManager, etc)

  how existing GSM modems support PPP GPRS contexts.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2
  Owner: Zhenhua Zhang <zhenhua.zhang@intel.com>

- On-demand SOCKS5 proxy support for MMS contexts.  When an MMS context type
  is created, oFono should create a SOCKS5 proxy.  When a client connects to
  the proxy, oFono can activate the GPRS context on-demand.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2

- Add support for GPRS suspended event.  Expose this to the UI by adding a new
  'Suspended' property on the DataConnectionManager D-Bus interface.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C1

  Complexity: C2
  Owner: Pekka Pessi <pekka.pessi@nokia.com>


Sim Toolkit
===========

- Support Display Text proactive command.  This should be implemented
  by making the appropriate call into the SimToolkitAgent.  This functionality
  should support normal and high-priority messages; packed gsm, unpacked
  gsm and ucs2 encoded strings; and immediate response command type.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2
  Owner: Andrzej Zaborowski <andrew.zaborowski@intel.com>

- Support Get Inkey proactive command.  This should be implemented by
  making the appropriate call into the SimToolkitAgent.  This functionality
  should support digits only, gsm alphabet only and ucs2 alphabet only
  user responses.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2
  Owner: Andrzej Zaborowski <andrew.zaborowski@intel.com>

- Support Get Input proactive command.  This should be implemented by
  making the appropriate call into the SimToolkitAgent.  This functionality
  should support digits only; packed gsm, unpacked gsm and ucs2 encoded
  responses; and opaque (e.g. password) user input.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2
  Owner: Andrzej Zaborowski <andrew.zaborowski@intel.com>

- Support More Time proactive command.  This command should essentially
  have no effect.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C1
  Owner: Andrzej Zaborowski <andrew.zaborowski@intel.com>

- Support the Play Tone proactive command.  This should be implemented
  by making the appropriate call into the SimToolkitAgent.  The sound
  that will be played will be determined by the agent based on the sound
  type.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2

- Support Refresh proactive command.  The specification defines 7 types
  of Refresh types:
	- NAA Initialization
	- NAA File Change Notification
	- NAA Initialization and File Change Notification
	- NAA Initialization and Full File Change Notification
	- UICC Reset
	- NAA Application Reset (2G only)
	- NAA Session Reset (3G only)

  The 'NAA Initialization' type will be ignored by oFono, it is assumed
  this is handled by the modem.

  For 'UICC Reset', 'NAA Application Reset' and 'NAA Session Reset' oFono
  will first check whether there are any calls or ussd operations active.
  If there are, the appropriate response will be sent (e.g. busy on call
  or screen busy terminal response.)  Otherwise a positive response will be
  sent to the driver.  In the case of a 'UICC Reset' the driver / modem
  can interpret this that it is safe to reset the UICC.

  Alternatively, the driver / modem can notify the core of the SIM removal
  / SIM insertion events without using the Refresh proactive command.  It
  is up to the driver / modem to perform a warm reset.  In particular, 3GPP
  31.111 mandates that any change to EFimsi is done by using 'UICC Reset',
  'NAA Application Reset' or 'NAA Session Reset'.  Please see 3GPP 31.111
  Section 6.4.7.1.

  Other types will be handled by oFono flushing the EF cache of the files
  affected (or the entire SIM cache in case of Full File Change Notifications)
  and re-reading the affected files.  Any properties derived from these
  Elementary Files will be updated and signaled using PropertyChanged.

- Support Setup Menu proactive command.  This should be supported by exporting
  the main menu as a set of attributes on the SimToolkit interface.  Both
  icons, menu items and the Alpha identifier should be exposed.  Support of
  this command implies support of the 'Menu Selection' Envelope.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2
  Owner: Andrzej Zaborowski <andrew.zaborowski@intel.com>

  Owner: Yang Gu <yang.gu@intel.com>

- Support Set Up Call proactive command.  If the UICC has indicated that
  the user should be informed, then the SimToolkitAgent will be called
  in order to request user's confirmation of the call setup.  If the user
  has confirmed, or if user's confirmation was not requested, oFono will
  setup the call and optionally inform the user.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C8

- Support Timer Management proactive command.  This should be handled
  completely internally to oFono and does not require any UI interaction.
  Support of this proactive command implies support of the 'Timer Expiration'
  Envelope.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2
  Owner: Andrzej Zaborowski <andrew.zaborowski@intel.com>

- Support Set Up Idle Mode Text proactive command.  The idle mode text
  should be exposed on the SimToolkit interface as a property.  The property
  changed signal should be emitted whenever the idle mode text string changes.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2
  Owner: Andrzej Zaborowski <andrew.zaborowski@intel.com>

- Support Send DTMF proactive command.  The DTMF characters are passed
  directly to the voicecall atom and the SimToolkitAgent is notified if the
  USIM has indicated it is acceptable to inform the user.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C4

- Support 'SMS-PP' Download Envelope.  Whenever a special type of SMS is
  received indicating that this is an SMS-PP Download message, this message
  will be sent to the SIM via an SMS-PP Download Envelope.  No user interaction
  will be required.  If the modem hardware supports this transparently, then
  no indication to oFono will be necessary.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2

- Support 'CBS-PP' Download Envelope.  Whenever a cell broadcast on a channel
  listed in EFcbmid is received, this broadcast will be sent to the SIM via
  a CBS-PP Download Envelope. No user interaction will be required.  If the
  modem hardware supports this transparently, then no indication to oFono
  will be necessary.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2

- Support SIM icon files as defined in 3GPP 31.102.  The icons should be
  automatically read from the SIM, converted to a usable format (such as XPM)
  and cached inside the daemon.  This will require to read the contents of
  EFimg and subsequently request the icon files.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C8
  Owner: Kristen Carlson Accardi <kristen@linux.intel.com>

Miscellaneous
=============

- Country / Operator specific emergency numbers.  Figure out how to support
  countries / operators with specific mandated emergency numbers which are
  not part of the standard emergency number list. This needs to be queried
  by the voicecall atom every time a new SIM is inserted.  The list is
  assumed to be managed by the modem.  If no such functionality is available,
  then the 3GPP mandated behavior is used.

  Complexity: C2
  Priority: High

- Bluetooth SAP Client support.  The Telit UC864-G devices support Bluetooth
  SAP client mode.  This requires the use of a modem side-channel to read the
  APDU & CPDU data and send it to the remote phone device over Bluetooth RFCOMM
  channel.

- Support for modem 'silent' reset notifications.  oFono will remove all atoms
  and re-initialize.

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C2

- Add support for Modem 'power down & lock' and 'unlock & power up'.  When the
  'power down & lock' is given, the calling application is noted and all
  other applications are blocked from powering up the modem.  Only the calling
  application can lift the lock.  Alternatively, if the calling application
  exits prematurely the lock is lifted as well.

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C2

- Add a property for Automatic Idle (sometimes referred to as Fast Dormancy)
  in the RadioSettings atom.  This property will enable or disable the use of
  automatic connection release by the modem for power consumption reasons.
  This is a major power-saving feature for phones, but can be ignored for USB
  sticks or PCI devices.

  If the modem does not support such a feature the property should never be
  exposed to the user.
